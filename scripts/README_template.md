# **ap.cx/assets**

“ap.cx/assets” is a collection of beautiful open-source fonts optimized and subsetted for modern browsers, released to facilitate web font integration.

## **Introduction**

“ap.cx/assets” offers a curated collection of high-quality, and SIL Open Font License (OFL) fonts that I love. 

The SIL Open Font License (OFL) is a free, libre and open source license specifically designed for fonts and related software based on our experience in font design and linguistic software engineering.

My main focus is to ensure a smooth integration of these fonts into web projects, optimizing them for fast and efficient delivery.

While **ap.cx/assets** is made available for general use, it has a special focus on serving fonts on my domain, AnotherPlanet.io.

## **Included Fonts**

For the moment, **ap.cx/assets** includes the following fonts:

{% for font in fonts %}
 - {{ font.css_family }} ({{ font.css_style }}) Version:{{ font.version }}    
{% endfor %}

I will continue to update and expand my font library to offer more fantastic font options in the future.
Feel free to explore and utilize these fonts in your web projects, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear from you.
